# NomUMockStudentPortal
This is the mock student portal we made in the school using Visual Basic

There are currently three default users: (Username: Password)
Jose: 1234
Juana: abcd

This Visual Basic program was created as a School project and to practice the Visual Basic in Visual Studio

There's nothing special about xd

But it can be referenced for knowledge in Visual Basic
